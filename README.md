# Xyrus
This plugin is my largest disaster so far, I wanted to make an Anti Illegal plugin but soon realised how hard
and complex it is, so I just decided to scrap it. Currently, this plugin has only one functionality, that is
deopping players on leave. This may be useful in cracked (offline) servers as another user may log into an admin's account.
I may in the future come back to this, but not anytime soon.

## Compatibility
This plugin was made for Minecraft 1.17.1, however,
other versions that use the same Spigot API should _technically_ work.
I will soon test out the plugin in different Minecraft Versions and list
the versions the plugin is compatible with.

## Installation
Download the plugin for the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/Xyrus/releases).
Make sure to select the compatible version. If you cannot find a compatible version,

Installation of the plugin is straight forward and is similar to rest of the
other plugins. Simply drag and drop the appropriate version of
`.jar` file into your server's `plugin` folder.
No configuration required, and the plugin will not create a folder or
any sort of configuration files such as `config.yml`.

You will need at least [Java 16](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html) or above to run this plugin, otherwise it may cause errors.
